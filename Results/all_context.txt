It’s	easy for	technology	companies	to	proclaim	that	solutions	are	too	hard, or	too	expensive,	or	too	threatening	to	their	bottom	line,	and	I	hope that	the	example	of	Yoti	and	our	customers	can	be	held	up	as	an affront	to	those	claims. As	requested,	I	have	compiled	some	data	about	the	recent	trends we’ve	seen	since	your	TikTok	action	in	February. Since	that	time,	we’ve	entered	into	three	new	integrations	with companies	in	the	social	media/live	streaming	industry.	Those three	platforms	are	used	by	a	total	of	105	million	people worldwide.	Additionally,	we’ve	had	conversations	with	a	number	of other	companies,	question	that	there	exists	a	sense	of	urgency	in	that	industry,	and I’ve	heard	a	number	of	people	mention	the	FTC	and	TikTok	in	the same	sentence	as	a	cautionary	tale. .
