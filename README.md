# FTC Lawsuit Data Analysis
Technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, but our legal system is struggling to keep up. That's why we conducted this data analysis on thousands of lawsuits issued by the Federal Trade Commission.

By examining the frequency of specific terms related to environmental, social, and governance issues, we identified critical gaps in the legal framework that leave companies unchecked and consumers vulnerable. Our findings provide a critical first step toward quantifying missing law. By shedding light on these issues, we hope to raise awareness of unaddressed problems in our legal system, promote better regulation of the tech industry, and inspire policy changes.
